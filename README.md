# Numeriacal_Soln_to_Partial_Differential_Eqn
This repository consists of codes solving partial differential equations. The code solves both one dimensional and two dimensional problems. It consists of codes solving parabolic and elliptical partial differential equations. This repository also consists of body fitted grid generation code for semi-ring &amp; temperature distribution across it.
